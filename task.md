The functionality below must be implemented in javascript:

On a page we initially have 4 elements: 1 red square, 1 blue square, 1 red circle, 1 blue circle. The user must be able to "drag&drop" the 2 circles. If the circle is placed over the square of the same color, we position the circle in the middle of the square (and afterwards we can no longer drag the circle), in any other case the circle returns to its initial position (after the drop).
